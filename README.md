## 🚀 Project Overview  

This project simulates the marks of **10 students** in **5 subjects** and uses NumPy to perform:  

- ✅ Array creation and inspection  
- ✅ Indexing and slicing (students vs subjects)  
- ✅ Statistical calculations (averages, totals, overall class performance)  
- ✅ Boolean filtering (finding failed students)  
- ✅ Broadcasting (normalizing marks to percentages)  
- ✅ Sorting and ranking (top performers)  
- ✅ Reshaping and transposition  
- ✅ Weighted scoring with matrix multiplication
