# 📊 Student Performance Analysis with NumPy  

A beginner-friendly project to **learn NumPy in depth** by analyzing student marks across multiple subjects.  
This project demonstrates **array creation, indexing, slicing, broadcasting, statistics, filtering, sorting, and matrix operations** in a real-world context.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

This project simulates the marks of **10 students** in **5 subjects** and uses NumPy to perform:  

- ✅ Array creation and inspection  
- ✅ Indexing and slicing (students vs subjects)  
- ✅ Statistical calculations (averages, totals, overall class performance)  
- ✅ Boolean filtering (finding failed students)  
- ✅ Broadcasting (normalizing marks to percentages)  
- ✅ Sorting and ranking (top performers)  
- ✅ Reshaping and transposition  
- ✅ Weighted scoring with matrix multiplication

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Python 3.x**  
- **NumPy** (Numerical Python)
